# hello-world
Hi! My name is Chidimma Nwaku. I'm interested in Data science and machine learning and I wish to provide meaningful solutions in the health sector. To do this, I've to start somewhere. So, I am currently learning python and I'm open to tips and collaboration!
I'm also new to github and right now I am learning and getting a feel around this place.
